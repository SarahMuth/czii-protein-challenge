# czii-protein-challenge
This repository contains tools and workflows for building machine learning models to identify and annotate protein complexes in 3D cellular images. By leveraging cryo-electron tomography (cryoET) data, the project aims to advance our ability to understand protein interactions in their natural environments.

THIS IS WORK IN PROGRESS!
